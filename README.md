How to use??
Unzip the files and drag the SolacianAllie folder into your project.
once imported, go to window, click better keyframing, then drag the tab over your animation window like this.

After that, drag and drop audio from your project into it, then go back to your animation, you will need to make two events, one at the start and one at the end of your audio.
Now you can animate to your audio :3
just know that the keyframer doesnt work unless its positioned like earlier.
