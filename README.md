## How to Use?

1.  Unzip the files and import the unity package into your project.
2.  Once imported, go to **Window**, click **Better Keyframing**, then drag the tab over your animation window like this:
**Important Note:** The keyframer doesn't work unless it's positioned like in the image below.

3.  Drag and drop any audio from your project into the animation window, make sure the audio is set to decompress on load, otherwise it might not work as intended.
4.  You will need to make two events in your animation: one at the start and one at the end of your audio.
5.  Now you can animate to your audio :3
